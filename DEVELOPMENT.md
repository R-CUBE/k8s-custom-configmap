# Developers guide

The operator is a Spring Boot project. To build the project, you need the following prerequisites:
- A local installation of JDK17
- Gradle `./gradlew clean build` to execute the tests and build the operator.

To test and deploy the operator in your local environment, you need the following setup:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the operator image with your local changes.
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to deploy the operator and test your changes.

## How I test my changes

Once I have made some changes to the code, I follow the below workflow:

- Run unit and integration tests.
- Build operator
  ```
    ~ ./gradlew clean build
  ```
- Build the operator docker image with the new changes.
  ```
    ~ minikube image build -t configs-operator:test_5 .
  ```
  Note that I used minikube client to build the docker image. Quote from [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#1-pushing-directly-to-the-in-cluster-docker-daemon-docker-env)
  > When using a container or VM driver (all drivers except none), you can reuse the Docker daemon inside minikube cluster. This means you donâ€™t have to build on your host machine and push the image into a docker registry. You can just build inside the same docker daemon as minikube which speeds up local experiments.
- Update [./install/cluster/Config-Operator.yaml](https://github.com/rameshmalla/k8s-custom-configmap/blob/main/install/cluster/Config-Operator.yaml#L31) with your new test image `configs-operator:test_5`.
- Apply the CRD and operator manifest in the `./install` folder.
  ```shell
        ~ kubectl apply -f ./install/cluster/configmapcustomresources.rcube.com-v1.yml       
          customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/configmapcustomresources.rcube.com created
  
        ~ kubectl apply -f ./install/cluster/Config-Operator.yaml
          namespace/configs-operator created
          serviceaccount/configs-operator created
          deployment.apps/configs-operator created
          clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/configs-operator-role created
          clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/configs-operator-admin created
   ```
- Apply application [./install/testing/app-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/rameshmalla/k8s-custom-configmap/blob/main/install/testing/app-deployment.yaml) manifest.
  ```shell
      ~ kubectl apply -f ./install/testing/app-deployment.yaml                             
        namespace/local created
        configmapcustomresource.rcube.com/application-toggles-config created
        deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
  ```

- Test my changes against the deployed application and the operator.
